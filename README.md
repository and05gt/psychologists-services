# Psychologists.Services

An application from a company offering the services of psychologists.

Includes several pages - a home page, a "Psychologists" page, which contains a list of psychologists that the user can sort alphabetically - ascending (A to Z) or descending (Z to A), by price - from the lowest price or from the highest, by popularity - from the lowest rating or from the highest. And a private "Favorites" page with psychologists who have been added by the user to their "favorites".

The user has the ability to authorize (register, log in, obtain data about the current user, log out).

The work was done using the Vite bundler on React, Redux for state management, React Router for routing. The Axios library is used for queries. User authorization and collection work are implemented using firebase. Responsive design for different devices.
